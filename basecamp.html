      <h1 class="container__item container__title--bold-italic">Hey, I'm George</h1>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I'm a product designer from London, UK. I've been designing and launching digital products for over 8 years. I started by co-founding a design agency called <a class="container__text--link" href="../work/qip">Qip Creative</a>. The Qip team then became part of <a class="container__text--link" href="https://www.papier.com">Papier</a>, a direct-to-consumer stationery brand we helped start in 2015, which is <a class="container__text--link" href="https://www.fasttrack.co.uk/company_profile/papier/">doing pretty well</a>. I've been leading product design there ever since.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I love making things. I make <a class="container__text--link" href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1183852292/tacon">podcasts</a> (not too serious) and <a class="container__text--link" href="../paintings">paintings</a> (pretty serious).</p>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">Why Basecamp?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Basecamp has a broad, holistic approach to the role of a product designer, one that I subscribe to. I have never understood why this approach is not shared by more organisations.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Basecamp builds products which challenge the status quo and offer people meaningful, insightful improvements to their lives.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">The Basecamp team are given autonomy and responsibility. I like that there's an expectation of self-management and mutual trust.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Unlike most technology companies, Basecamp's business model allows principles and ambition to coexist, without the one slowly eroding the other. You stand for what you believe and you act on it.</p>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">Why this role?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">This role would allow me to focus on my craft as a designer. I still love designing software, and I don't want to leave that behind. As a senior product designer I would be able to push my abilities to the next level.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Similar roles at other companies can be restrictive. This job would allow me to have an impact while also retaining a meaningful part of the project ownership I enjoy currently. </p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">The prospect of making coding part of my day job is extremely exciting. Until now it has been something I have done outside of work (like this website). The ability to be more hands-on with my approach is a big draw for me.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I thrive in small teams of talented people. I believe it's the best way to get stuff done. I think this is a role where I can learn by surrounding myself with brilliant people, and maybe even bring a new perspective.</p>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">Why me?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I'm a good fit for Basecamp and this role specifically.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I share Basecamp's views on what a product designer is. Throughout my career I have always done product strategy, product management, user research (just enough) and UX/UI design as if they are part of the same job. <a class="container__text--link" href="../work/papier-app">Here's a good example</a>. My ideas on product design will feel familiar, because I developed them in part by reading Rework, Getting Real, and the SvN blog. </p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I've used Basecamp on-and-off since 2013, and Hey has already changed how I do email for the better. But there's much more work to do. I have years of experience <a class="container__text--link" href="../work/qip">creating new products</a> and <a class="container__text--link" href="../work/stationery-editor">iteratively improving existing ones</a>. I can help Basecamp tackle the next set of big challenges.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I have always worked as a manager of one. I don't need hand-holding, but I know when to ask for help. I know how to prioritise and get stuff done. I know the importance of regular, clear communication and of making time for work.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I'm a great designer. Whether its sketching rough ideas on paper, designing details in Figma, or prototyping in Framer, I'm at home making things beautiful and intuitive. But, importantly, I'm not a debilitating perfectionist<span style="cursor:help;"> </span><!-- oops! ;) --> . </p>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">Why now?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I'm leaving the UK and moving to the USA with my wife. Keeping my job wasn't an option (no remote work at Papier!).</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I've loved working at Papier. It's a business I helped found, and it's going from strength to strength. The people I hired when we ran Qip are still working with me. I've been building websites with Papier's CTO for almost a decade. I'm looking for the team I can spend the next 10 years with. I think it should be Basecamp.</p>
