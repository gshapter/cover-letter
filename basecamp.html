      <h1 class="container__item container__title--bold-italic">Hey, I'm George</h1>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I'm a product designer from London, UK. I've been designing and launching digital products for over 8 years. I started by co-founding a design agency called <a class="container__text--link" href="https://georgeshapter.com/qip">Qip Creative</a>. The Qip team then became part of <a class="container__text--link" href="https://www.papier.com">Papier</a>, a direct-to-consumer stationery brand we helped start in 2015, which is doing pretty well. I've been leading product design there ever since.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I love making things, and setting myself ambitious personal projects. Currently I spend a lot of my time <a class="container__text--link" href="https://georgeshapter.com/paintings">painting</a> and cooking.</p>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">Why Basecamp?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Basecamp has a broad, holistic approach to the role of a product designer, one that I subscribe to. I have never understood why this approach is not shared by more organisations.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Basecamp builds products which challenge the status quo and offer people meaningful, insightful improvements to their lives.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">The Basecamp team are given autonomy and responsibility. I like that there's an expectation of self-management and mutual trust.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Unlike most technology companies, Basecamp's business model allows principles and ambition to coexist, without the one slowly eroding the other. You stand for what you believe and you act on it.</p>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">Why this role?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">This role would allow me to focus on my craft as a designer. I still love designing software, and I don't want to leave that behind. As a senior product designer I can continue push my abilities to the next level.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">At other companies, a senior product designer role can be restrictive. This role allows me to have an impact and retain a meaningful part of the project ownership I enjoy currently. </p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Making code a part of my day job is something that I am extremely excited about. Until now it has been something I have done outside of work (like this website). The ability to be more hands on with my approach is a big draw for me.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I thrive in small teams of talented people. I believe it's the best way to get stuff done. I think this is a role where I can learn by surrounding myself with brilliant people.</p>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">Why me?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I'm a good fit for Basecamp and this role specifically.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I share Basecamp's views on what a product designer is. Throughout my career I have always done product strategy, product management, user research (just enough) and UX/UI design as if they are part of the same job. I combined all of these, plus a little prototyping in code, while working on Papier's greeting card app. My ideas on product design will feel familiar, because I developed them in part by reading Rework, Getting Real, and the SvN blog. </p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I've used Basecamp on-and-off since 2013, and Hey has already changed how I do email for the better. But there's much more work to do. I have years of experience creating new products and iteratively improving existing ones. I can help Basecamp tackle the next set of big challenges.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I have always worked as a manager of one. I don't need hand-holding, but I know when to ask for help. I know how to prioritise and get stuff done. I know the importance of regular, clear communication and of making time for work.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I care about how things are made. The Internet has so much good in it - it taught me everything I know about all this stuff, mostly for free - but we have a responsibility to leave it in a better place than we found it.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I'm a great designer. Whether its sketching rough ideas on paper, designing details in Figma, or prototyping in Framer, I'm at home making things beautiful and intuitive. I'm also not a perfectionist . </p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I've spent my career being more than just a designer. I've helped build businesses and products from zero to one. And beyond. I've built relationships with clients, mentored designers (and founders), worked closely with developers, interviewed customers, shaped product strategies. I have the ability to adapt to new challenges as they come.</p>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">Why now?</h2>

      <h1 class="container__item container__title--bold-italic">Hey, I'm George</h1>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">Who?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I'm a product designer from London, UK. I've been designing and launching digital products for over 8 years. I started by co-founding a design agency called <a class="container__text--link" href="https://georgeshapter.com/qip">Qip Creative</a>. The Qip team then became part of <a class="container__text--link" href="https://www.papier.com">Papier</a>, a direct-to-consumer stationery brand we helped start in 2015, which is doing pretty well.

      <p class="container__item container__text">I love making things, and setting myself ambitious personal projects. Currently I spend a lot of my time <a class="container__text--link" href="https://georgeshapter.com/paintings">painting</a> and cooking.</p>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">Why Basecamp?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I share Basecamp's holistic approach to the product designer role. Throughout my career I have always done product strategy, product management, user research (just enough) and UX/UI design as if they are part of the same job. I have never understood organizations that don't treat designers the same way. I combined all of these, plus a little prototyping in code, while working on Papier's greeting card app. My ideas on product design will feel familiar, because I developed them in part by reading Rework, Getting Real, and the SvN blog.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">In my next role I want to continue working like this. But I also want to build on my experience and hone my craft. The ability to combine skills and learn new ones is one of my strengths, and as a team that is always pushing themselves (and the industry) forward, Basecamp is the best place I can think of to bleugh.</p>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">OK, so you think you're a good fit then?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Sure! I'm a conscientious, creative person with a desire to build extraordinary things. I know how to prioritise what matters and get stuff done. I have years of experience in iterative software development. I enjoy talking to customers and understanding Jobs to be Done. I'm at home when designing and prototyping (pen and paper, Sketch, Figma, Adobe Suite, Framer, in the browser, etc.). Most of all I enjoy working with a small, talented team to ship experiences that customers love. People also really like working with me. You can ask them.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">It's worth mentioning that writing production code is not currently part of my job. However, I have built simple websites before, like the one you're on now. I also write code outside of work. This year I have been learning Ruby, for example. Throughout my career I have worked closely with – sitting right next to – Rails developers, so I'm familiar with how Rails apps work, and with .erb. </p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">But I'm not an expert (yet). I'm excited about the opportunity to build on my front-end skills and be more hands-on as part of my job.
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">Why now?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I'm leaving the UK and moving to the USA with my wife. Keeping my job wasn't an option (no remote work at Papier!), so my last day is December 11th – just in time for me to start with you?? </p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Leaving Papier has been a tough decision. It's a business I helped found, and it's going from strength to strength. The team is amazing. The people I hired when we ran Qip are still working with me. I've been building websites with Papier's CTO for almost a decade. Why am I telling you this? Because Basecamp is a rare example of a technology company that expects it's team to stick around. I'm looking for somewhere to spend the next 10 years.
</p>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">Interested?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I hope so. I am. This job would be a dream come true for me.
