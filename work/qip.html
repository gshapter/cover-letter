      <p class="container__item container__text">In 2012 I co-founded Qip Creative, a product design and development consultancy. I was responsible for design, in addition to new business development, finance, hiring, and managing our client relationships. </p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Qip provided services including brand design, product strategy, design sprints, UX/UI design and software development. We worked with early stage startups and internationally known organisations, often in the  e-commerce and the culture sectors. My favourite projects offered the chance to combine our knowledge of both areas.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Below you can find a selection of some of the work completed during my time working on Qip.</p>
