          <p class="container__item container__text">The product customisation that happens in the editor is the magic moment when a user develops a personal relationship with the product. During my time at Papier, the editor has gone through rounds of iteration.</p>
          <p class="container__item container__text">Recent user testing revealed pain points, particularly around touch interactions (Papier.com is fully responsive, with 75% of traffic on mobile). I knew this was impacting our conversion rate. In response I recently decided to redesign the UX and work around what we found to be insurmountable mobile browser constraints.</p>
          <p class="container__item container__text">As of writing, this project is ongoing.</p>

            The challenge was to design a solution that balanced:
            <ul>
            <li>Technical feasibility across various browsers and devices</li>
            <li>Simplicity for the user, regardless of technical skill</li>
            <li>Sufficient depth of creative options</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold">UX</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">While the editor has an end goal (adding the product to the cart), it's also a space where the user can be creative. I developed a number of approaches with the goal of introducing the design tools without overwhelming the users. My solution was to have the UI appear progressively, and only when needed.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">One major challenge on mobile screens was to display text editing UI on screen while not obscuring the text itself.</p>

      <p class="container__item container__text">Papier attracts people of all ages and technical proficiency. It was important that the editing experience was engaging and intuitive. The combination of an uncluttered screen and some subtle animation would guide users to begin their product customisation - that was the plan anyway. To test this assumption I built a high-fidelity prototype and trialed the interactions with a handful of users, tweaking the design in response to feedback.</p>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold">Design</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">The exact UI a customer sees depends on the type of stationery product being customised. Simple products, such as a printed photo, have just one interaction while a more complex product like a wall calendar supports editable elements across 13 printed pages, with text styling and layout options.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">The editor had to support all levels of complexity. The various modular blocks required a consistent, intuitive visual design language, and the page layout had to feel balanced regardless of which combination of tools were available.</p>
