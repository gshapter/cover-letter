      <h1 class="container__item container__title--regular">Papier Cards for iOS</h1>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold">Challenge</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Papier had two main customer groups: wedding organisers, and greeting card senders.  The Papier website offered the same experience for both, despite the fact that each had different requirements:</p>
      <img class="container__item container__image--inline" src="/images/table.png" alt="Table illustrating some differences between customer groups">
      <p class="container__item container__text">I saw an opportunity to design a product experience around the specific needs of the greeting card customer, one that would encourage repeat purchases and increase the lifetime value of those customers.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Native mobile apps are perfect for completing quick, focussed tasks on a regular basis. Apps provide benefits to the user such as easy access via the home screen, no need to log in regularly, access to photos, and even push notifications (when deployed as a genuine value-add).</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">We decided that the most efficient way to test such an idea was to build an MVP app and release it to our users. Papier already had the catalogue of card designs set up, the PDF rendering system built, and all our payment and delivery ecosystem ready to go.</p>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold">UX</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">To ensure a quicker build, we decided to avoid everything to do with styling text. Users would be able to write their message but not pick fonts, colours, etc. This actually helped me create a streamlined, linear user journey. I mapped out a retention loop to illustrate the broad product strategy (a), as well as various user flows, e.g. (b).</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">My UX design process emphasises speed and collaboration. Sketching on paper is the quickest way to explore ideas. Tools like Figma and Invision then allow me to produce prototypes in minutes, so validating ideas can happen fast.</p>

      <img class="container__item container__image--inline" src="/images/appUX2.png" alt="User flow (b)">
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold">Interaction and prototyping</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I produced a clickable prototype and used this to demonstrate how a simplified card buying process could feel. From that, our developers produced a working proof of concept.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">This test app was shared via TestFlight with the Papier team and investors, who agreed to prioritise the project. From there we set about designing and building a more polished release version.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">There were a couple of key animations I wanted to get right. Tapping on a design from a list of products would zoom to reveal it in more detail.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Tapping a button at this point would open the card. This animation would confirm that the chosen design was on a folded card, while making it clear that the next step was writing inside it. The goal was to provide clarity and context to the user.</p>

      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold">Design</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">The visual design followed Papierâ€™s existing brand aesthetic, with occasional pops of friendly colour. Mostly, I let the products do the talking and kept navigational UI in line with Apple human interface guidelines. Good design is invisible, right?</p>

      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold">Results</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">A month after launching, Papier Cards was featured as App of The Day on the App Store. Repeat rates for greeting card customers using the app was 150% higher than those who bought via the website. Customers were overwhelmingly happy with the experience, despite the limited range and customisation features.</p>
