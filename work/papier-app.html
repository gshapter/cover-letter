        <h2>Papier needed to increase greeting card product repeat rates</h2>
        <p>Papier had two main customer groups: wedding organizers, and greeting card senders. The Papier website offered the same experience for both, despite the fact that each had different requirements:</p>
        <p>We decided to build an MVP mobile app that was focussed exclusively on buying greeting cards, and test this new experience with our users. This new product would encourage repeat purchases and increase the lifetime value of those customers.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="content content__text">
        <h2>UX</h2>
        <p>To ensure a quicker build, we decided to avoid everything to do with styling text. Users would be able to write their message but not pick fonts, colours, etc. This actually helped me create a streamlined, linear user journey. I mapped out a retention loop to illustrate the broad product strategy (a), as well as various user flows, e.g. (b).</p>
        <p>My UX design process emphasises speed and collaboration. Sketching on paper is the quickest way to explore ideas. Tools like Figma and Invision then allow me to produce prototypes in minutes, so validating assumptions can happen fast.</p>

        <h2>Interaction and prototyping</h2>
        <p>I produced a clickable prototype and used this to demonstrate how a simplified card buying process could feel. From that, our developers produced a working proof of concept.</p>
        <p>This test app was shared via TestFlight with the Papier team and investors, who agreed to prioritize the project. From there we set about designing and building a more polished release version.</p>
        <p>There were a couple of key animations I wanted to get right. Tapping on a design from a list of products would zoom to reveal it in more detail.</p>
        <p>Tapping a button at this point would open the card. This animation would confirm that the chosen design was on a folded card, while making it clear that the next step was writing inside it. The goal was to provide clarity and context to the user.</p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>The visual design followed Papier’s existing brand aesthetic, with occasional pops of friendly color. Mostly, I let the products do the talking and kept navigational UI in line with Apple human interface guidelines. Good design is invisible, right?</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>A month after launching, Papier Cards was featured as App of The Day on the App Store. Repeat rates for greeting card customers using the app was 150% higher than those who bought via the website. Customers were overwhelmingly happy with the experience, despite the limited range and customization features.</p>
