      <h1 class="container__item container__title--bold-italic">Hey, I'm George</h1>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">Who?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I'm a product designer from London, UK. I've been designing and launching digital products for over 8 years. I started by co-founding a design agency called <a class="container__text--link" href="https://georgeshapter.com/qip">Qip Creative</a>. The Qip team then became part of <a class="container__text--link" href="https://www.papier.com">Papier</a>, a direct-to-consumer stationery brand we helped start in 2015, and that's doing pretty well. I've been leading product design there ever since.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I love making things, and setting myself ambitious personal projects. Currently I spend a lot of my time <a class="container__text--link" href="https://georgeshapter.com/paintings">painting</a> and cooking.</p>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">Why Basecamp?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">My work has always combined a bunch of roles into one: product strategist, researcher, UX/UI designer, and more. It's a holistic approach to product design that Basecamp shares. I know this because I developed my own ideas in part by reading Rework, Getting Real, and the SvN blog. </p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">In past roles it has always been necessary for me to proactively develop and communicate my own goals – and then execute on them. Often this has meant learning new skills. I've had to be a self-starter, and I'm no stranger to the 'manager of one' concept. This broad operating range is one of my strengths, and something I want to retain as I progress in my career. Basecamp is the best place I can think of to do this.</p>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">OK, so you think you're a good fit then?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Sure! I'm a conscientious, creative person with a desire to build extraordinary things. I know how to prioritise what matters and get stuff done. I have years of experience in iterative software development. I enjoy talking to customers and understanding Jobs to be Done. I'm at home when designing and prototyping (pen and paper, Sketch, Figma, Adobe Suite, Framer, in the browser, etc.). Most of all I enjoy working with a small, talented team to ship experiences that customers love. People also really like working with me. You can ask them.</p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">It's worth mentioning that writing production code is not currently part of my job. However, I have built simple websites before, like the one you're on now. I also write code outside of work. This year I have been learning Ruby, for example. Throughout my career I have worked closely with – sitting right next to – Rails developers, so I'm familiar with how Rails apps work, and with .erb. </p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">But I'm not an expert (yet). I'm excited about the opportunity to build on my front-end skills and be more hands-on as part of my job.
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">Why now?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I'm leaving the UK and moving to the USA with my wife. Keeping my job wasn't an option (no remote work at Papier!), so my last day is December 11th – just in time for me to start with you?? </p>
      <p class="container__item container__text">Leaving Papier has been a tough decision. It's a business I helped found, and it's going from strength to strength. The team is amazing. The people I hired when we ran Qip are still working with me. I've been building websites with Papier's CTO for almost a decade. Why am I telling you this? Because Basecamp is a rare example of a technology company that expects it's team to stick around. I'm looking for somewhere to spend the next 10 years.
</p>
      <h2 class="container__item container__subtitle--bold-italic">Interested?</h2>
      <p class="container__item container__text">I hope so. I am. This job would be a dream come true for me.
